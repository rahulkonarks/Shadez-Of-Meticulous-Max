Celebrated my 10th Birthday with family.

Read the 2nd chapter of my new python book (Python 	Programming crash course by Eric Matthes).

Brainstormed about the digital fest at school but couldn’t conclude anything.

I started learning some web development as in HTML, CSS and PHP/JS. I have already built some fun web projects [that will be uploaded to git hub soon].

I have been experimenting different flavors of Linux I.e.: Ubuntu, Kali Linux and Parrot OS; personally I find all of them great.
